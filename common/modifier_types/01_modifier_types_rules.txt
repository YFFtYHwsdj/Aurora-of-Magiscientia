# Modifiers used as flags to determine if game rules are active or not go here
# neutral: render as neutral rather than good or bad, most game rules should be neutral
# boolean: render as Yes or No rather than 1 or 0, most game rules should be boolean in nature
# invert: render a boolean true as No and boolean false as Yes, helpful for describing game rules where the default state (modifier non-existent) is the presence rather than absence of something
